# Websites
Websites I have made, throughout learning full stack web developing,
some of these websites were done following a tutorial and some were done on my own.
The ones that have been done on my own will be labeled as "remake" ex. starbucks-remake.
These will also be uploaded to my portfolio and will be interactive to the users wishing to
explore the page.

These websites will keep being updated until the website is fully finished.


# Note
If you fork these please know that these are remakes of current sites/followed tutorials and I do not
own any of them, anything that happens to you is not my responsibility.
